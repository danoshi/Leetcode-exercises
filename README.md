# LeetCode Solutions and Course Exercises

Within this repository, you'll discover a collection of LeetCode problems that I've tackled, along with a README detailing my thought process for each one.

Additionally, I've included exercises from various courses focused on learning data structures and algorithms. In the README, I strive to provide explanations for these exercises, accompanied by illustrative code demonstrating the algorithms or data structures discussed.

1) Inside the `ArrayExercise` folder, you'll encounter various types of array problems that require solving specific challenges.

2) The `MathExercise` folder contains mathematical problems for exploration.

3) Within the `Sorting and Searching` folder, you'll discover problems related to sorting and searching, all of which I've solved.

4) Moving on to `StringsExercise`, this section encompasses a diverse range of solved problems centered around string manipulation and related topics.

5) Lastly, in the `frontendmasters` folder, you'll find solved exercises along with detailed descriptions focusing on data structures and algorithms.
